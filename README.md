## Install from AUR (Arch Linux):
  
  ```
  yay -S luminance
  ```

## Install deb package (Debian and Ubuntu based distros):
Latest deb release is available on the releases page https://github.com/sidevesh/Luminance/releases

* Version 1.0.4 is the last supported version for Ubuntu before 24.04, Debian or any other Debian based distro that does not have atleast libadwaita 1.5 version

## Install rpm package (Fedora, OpenSUSE and other rpm based distros):
Latest rpm release is available on the releases page https://github.com/sidevesh/Luminance/releases

## Install from source

### Dependencies
- GTK 4.0
- Libadwaita
- ddcutil library package (typically libddcutil or libddcutil-dev if not already installed with ddcutil)

### Steps
1. Firstly, ensure that all the dependencies are installed:

    ##### Arch Linux:
    ```
    pacman -S --needed glib2 gtk4 libadwaita ddcutil
    ```
    
    ##### Ubuntu-based distros (credit @aidengilmartin):
    ```
    sudo apt install gcc libglib2.0-dev libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev libddcutil-dev
    ```
    ##### Fedora:
    ```
    sudo dnf install gcc glib2-devel gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel libddcutil-devel
    ```

2. Ensure that your user has access to the i2c devices:
https://www.ddcutil.com/i2c_permissions/

3. Clone this repo along with its submodules:
    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sidevesh/Luminance.git
    ```

4. Change into the `Luminance` directory and execute build.sh to build this application:
    ```
    cd Luminance
    ./build.sh
    ```

5. This should result in a binary that you can execute to contol the brightness:
    ```
    ./build/app
    ```

6. To install this binary for all users execute 'install.sh' as root:
    ```
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```

    You should now be able to find Luminance in your list of apps
    * Installing the application is necessary for it to work because it uses gsettings to store preferences and will need the schema files to be installed.
      You can read the install.sh script and copy the schema files yourself if you don't want to do all the install steps.


## Usage

Start the application normally or you can also use the app via cli interface:
